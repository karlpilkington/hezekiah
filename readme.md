# DonateServ

DonateServ is open source donation processing and campaign management software.

Based on a few conditions, you may want to consider DonateServ for your own organization. You'll need to be using Stripe for card processing, for starters. You'll also need Google Apps for access to the admin panel. And of course, you'll need some technical background to set this all up on Heroku and Postgres and hook it up to your site.

## What DonateServ is

* Stripe-based donation processing for one-time and recurring donations
* Campaign creation and reporting software 
* Freedom to build donation pages from scratch on your website, while retaining PCI compliance (via Stripe) keeping donation processing costs down.

## What DonateServ isn't

* Proper accounting software (there is no way to withdrawal from a campaign account to see current balance, for example)

## TODO:

* Reject non-https donations

## This is neat! How can I thank you?

Thanks! DonateServ was originally built for my personal nonprofit, [Illuminate Nations](http://www.illuminatenations.org). We support a variety of children's homes across southern Asia and are supporting programs to help women coming out of the sex trade industry. Please take a look at what we're doing, and if DonateServ has helped your own fundraising efforts, please consider a donation.
