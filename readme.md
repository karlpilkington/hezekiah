# Hezekiah Fundraising Platform
*You worked hard to show passionate people your cause.*

*Hezekiah make it easier for donors to get involved and donate*

## Features

* Simple fundraising.
* We're not touching, storing, or risking your donors credit card data. We process all our transactions on the renowned credit card processor called Stripe. Check them out for details on security.
* Simple fundraising data. Accessible reports make fundraising intelligence easy.
* Want to make your donation monthly? It's only a checkbox away. Want to cancel that monthly donation? That'll be two clicks. Monthly donations should be as easy to cancel as emails.
* Duplicate donation checks - ever seen accidental duplicate donations? We'll prevent those&dagger;.
* Refunds, chargebacks, etc? We'll make sure those are taken care of in your records so you don't have to.
* Want to do-it-yourself? Build your own donation forms; with your own styling, validation, and techniques, then `POST` the donation to us&Dagger;.

*&dagger; De-duplication runs on a 5-minute basis for single donations and campaign basis for monthly donations.*

*&Dagger; Hezekiah will only store documented donor data - not additional fields specific to your campaign. HTTPS is required on your custom donation page.*

## Integrations

* **Mailchimp** - Ddd donors to a list and places them in an *interest group* with the same name as the campaign they donated to. It's nice to email donors updates!
